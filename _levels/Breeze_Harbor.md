The character design in this level is pretty good. The Land Blubbers are appropriately annoying: hopping around noisily, extinguishing your fires, and laughing in your face. The fire vs. water thing is a nice touch, though it isn't really borne out by [Zephyr]({{'levels/Zephyr.html' | relative_url}}).

Otherwise, there isn't much exciting about this level aesthetically. The skybox is pretty, and the floating boats are *kind of* cool, but it's definitely not the coolest stuff in the game.

The Breeze Builders (birds) are being sabotaged by the Land Blubbers (weird slug-like people). The Blubbers keep putting out the fires powering the birds' machines, so Spyro needs to get rid of them and re-light the fires.

A cool thing about this level is that it connects with [Zephyr]({{'levels/Zephyr.html' | relative_url}}), which takes place on the frontlines of the war between the Breeze Builders and the Land Blubbers. In Zephyr though, Spyro fights *with* the Land Blubbers, which is... interesting. Spyro clearly has no moral quandries with fighting both sides - as long as we get those talismans!

In terms of gameplay, a lot of this level is quite frustrating. The infamous "trouble on the trolley" quest sticks out as a rough spot, but flying between floating boats and aiming finicky cannons are problematic as well.

On the whole, Breeze Harbor is an alright level, but nothing to write home about.
