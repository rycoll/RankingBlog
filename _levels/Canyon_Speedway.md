Canyon Speedway is a fairly good-looking place, although as a speedway level we don't get a lot of opportunity to look at it closely. The rocks and lava don't fit much with its homeworld, [Winter Tundra]({{'/levels/Winter_Tundra.html' | relative_url}}), but most levels don't!
<!--excerpt-->
There is essentially no story here. It's another speedway level. In the orb challenge, we help Hunter test out his "toy" plane by flying it around, shooting at blimps. This perhaps gives some insight into Hunter's character, but there's not much to say other than that.

Speedway levels are always a bit of fun (at least until the 10th retry). The orb challenge in this level can be a bit frustrating though: sharp turns require super fast reactions or (more likely) lots of trial and error as you learn Hunter's path and the positions of the blimps.

Overall... it's another speedway level. And probably not the best one.
