Apparently Dragon Shores has skylines and architectural features that are similar to worlds in the first game. This makes sense narratively, since Dragon Shores is part of the dragon world, while Avalar isn't. It's a nice touch!

Generally, Dragon Shores is a nice place to look around. There's a bunch of cute vignettes to see and interact with.

Dragon Shores serves entirely as a reward level for playing the rest of the game, which is awesome! Spyro has been talking about this place since the very first cutscene, so it's exciting to actually get to walk around it and do stuff!

There isn't a lot of extra story here, but there's some cute little scenes and we get to see a lot of characters from previous levels come back to take a bow.

It's also interesting that this place is run by Gnorcs! Apparently Spyro's efforts in the first game had long-reaching effects for dragon-gnorc relations.

We get to play a few minigames here, which is neat. One of them is a return to the troublesome trolley ride from [Breeze Harbor]({{'/levels/Breeze_Harbor.html' | relative_url}}), which is potentially frightening, but it plays a bit better without Fisher the Breezebuilder breathing down your neck.

Dragon Shores could have just been a little cutscene, where Spyro finally gets to take his holiday. Instead, we get to play it! Fantastic.
