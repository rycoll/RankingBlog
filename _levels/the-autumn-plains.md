Autumn Plains is **super** lovely. As with all homeworlds, the music and atmosphere are very relaxing, and there are lots of little places to explore around. There's a hidden path to the top of the castle, from which you can see (and glide to) a great view of the whole area. There's even a nice little pool! The skybox is beautiful too, which earns it big points from me.

As a homeworld, Autumn Plains doesn't have much going on in terms of story or setting. Ripto shows up and takes over, and it's your job to throw him back out - that's about it. We don't really learn anything about the world from Autumn Plains.

There isn't much to say about the gameplay of Autumn Plains, since it is mainly a hub for connecting other levels. We learn the Climb ability here, and there are some pretty nice gliding opportunities - otherwise the gameplay is fairly plain.

Autumn Plains is an excellent homeworld. It's a place to relax, explore and (ultimately) advance the main story. There just isn't much to it other than that however.
