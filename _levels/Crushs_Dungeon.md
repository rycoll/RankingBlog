This whole boss fight is set in an underground dungeon, which means there's no skybox. Which is always a shame, because a nice skybox is great. The dungeon itself is colourful though, and the coloured panels that Crush uses to attack you (somehow?) are cool enough.

Crush's design is alright. He's a big dinosaur dude with a club.

It's a boss fight. That's pretty much the story here. When you win, Ripto is expelled from Summer Forest, and he moves on to bother a different homeworld.

Crush has some basic boss mechanics. He does some attacks, which you have to avoid, and then you get him while he's vulnerable. His attacks get more varied as the fight goes on, although he only has 3 in total. It's not a bad boss fight, but it's also not very interesting.

There's nothing too exciting about Crush's Dungeon. It's a pretty standard boss level.
