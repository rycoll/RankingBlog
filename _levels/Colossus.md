The skybox in this level is super colourful and nice, so big thumbs up for that. The layout and appearance of the level is pretty good - everything feels quite big and sparse. The enemies have some personality, which is good because they're pretty much just different kinds of goats. The voice acting and animation of the monks is probably some of the funniest in the game. <!--base32-cnw66tbje1u0-base32--> The monks are being terrorised by a fearsome yeti. I think that they captured it, and then it got loose? It's not a very substantial story, especially when the yeti ends up dying unexpectedly just before the big boss fight. The whole thing is played for humour, which actually works out pretty well.

The monks here are clearly supposed to be related to the natives of Idol Springs, although the connection feels a bit superficial. <!--base32-cnw66tbje1u0-base32--> Two of the orbs in this level come from a tucked-away ice hockey minigame. The ice hockey isâ€¦ alright. It's pretty fun, but ice physics can always become a bit tiresome.

You get the other orb by exploring the level looking for evil statues to exorcise with fire. This is pretty basic, but it's a good time. <!--base32-cnw66tbje1u0-base32--> Colossus is a pretty cool level on the whole.
