This level looks great! The colours of the snow, ice, hills, caves and sky are all great. The design and voice acting of the cavemen is very characterful. The enemies are cool (haha) and often have great animations (melting when you flame them, for example). Like many enemies in the game, they interact with their environment, freezing cavemen in blocks of ice until dealt with.

There's also a cute kitty in this level, which is a massive plus.

Some Ice Wizards have captured the chieftan of some artic cavemen, and Spyro needs to free him. The other cavemen seem to want him back primarily because he has all their hockey tickets, so we've got high stakes for this one. They seem to be referring to the hockey in Colossus, which is a nice inter-world reference to tie everything together a bit. At the end of the level, it turns out the chieftan traded away the hockey tickets anyway, which is a classic *Spyro 2* kind of gag.

It's fun to watch the cavemen work together in weird ways to solve problems. The cavemen are pretty character-ful dudes on the whole, which good voice acting and jokes.

This level is fun! Purging the ice wizards and thawing out cavemen is a good time, and the orb challenges are great too. One involves Super Flying around, flaming respawning spiders; it's quite tricky, but pretty fun, and the spiders look and sound really goofy. The other involves feeding fish to a cute snow leopard called George, before reuniting him with his worried caveman owner, which is obviously lovely.

A very delightful level, on all axes.
