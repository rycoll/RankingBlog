Cloud Temples is pretty weird, which I count as a good thing! Unfortunately, it's also a little bland, at least colour-wise. The floating platforms at the very start of the level, and the warlock magic in general, deserve a bit of praise though.

The skybox is a nice, mountain sunset.

A bad warlock has stolen a nice wizards wand, and is reaking havoc. Spyro has to get it back. Pretty simple stuff.

We meet Secret Agent Zero here, who is clearly related somehow to the secret agents in [Scorch]({{'/levels/Scorch.html' | relative_url}})! It's a nice touch, and helps make the whole game feel a bit more like a cohesive (if confusing) world.

Cloud Temples has its own unique power-up: the Super Freeze! It's a cool new toy to play with, although the quests involved with it can be a little frustrating since they rely on precision and quick timing.

While it's nice to meet Secret Agent Zero, his quest is one of the most annoying orb challenges in the entire game. It relies almost entirely on trial and error, and forces the player to start from scratch every time.

Tucked away towards the end of the game, Cloud Temples is a little forgettable to me. It's got some cool tricks to show off, but isn't too impressive on the whole.
