It's okay. Colourful!
<!--excerpt-->
This level has a bit more ludo-narrative dissonance than most, which is why I'm giving it a lowish score.
Every level in Spyro 2 begins with some native of the world asking Spyro to solve a problem. At the end of the level, the problem is solved and Spyro is rewarded with a gem or a talisman. This generally just means getting to the end of the level, where some sort of special switch can flipped, solving the problem. In Glimmer, the Gemcutters are being invaded by lizards, who are stealing their precious gems. Spyro's task is to stop the lizards stealing the gems of these cute squirrel people.

The quests are pretty decent.

Overall, not bad at all!
