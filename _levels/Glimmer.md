Glimmer is a lovely, colourful place to run around in while learning the basic controls of the game. The sky is bright, but you can see the moon and stars. The Gemcutter's buildings are heavily-adorned with gems, which I guess impresses the importance of gems on new players, as well as looking cool. The Gemcutters themselves are cute little squirrel people. The music for this level is pretty funky too, so good overall!

This level has a bit more ludo-narrative dissonance than most, which is why I'm giving it a lowish score.
Every level in Spyro 2 begins with some native of the world asking Spyro to solve a problem. At the end of the level, the problem is solved and Spyro is rewarded with a gem or a talisman. 

In Glimmer, the Gemcutters are being invaded by gem-stealing lizards. Spyro's task is to stop these lizards. However, it is entirely possible to get to the end of the level without battling *any* lizards. On the other hand, you *do* need to pick up 100 gems in Glimmer in order to pay a bridge toll. Spyro could be seen as just another gem-stealing lizard by the Gemcutters, so it's a little weird when they reward you for your efforts at the end of the level.

Many levels in Spyro are thematically paired. Glimmer has no ties to other levels, which is kind of a bummer (although fair enough for the very first level in the game).

The spitting-rocks-at-lizards quest is fairly fun. It gives you a tour of the level, and helps new players learn to control the camera.

The other two quests involve flaming crystal lamps while super-flying around, which is also pretty fun. 

Overall, the gameplay in Glimmer is pretty solid. It's not too in-your-face with the tutorialising, which is mostly dished out slowly between here and [Summer Forest]({{'/levels/Summer_Forest.html' | relative_url}}).

Glimmer definitely gets the game off on the right foot.
