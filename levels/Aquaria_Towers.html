<meta name="description" content="Aquaria Towers has some fun character design. The cruel “Shock Stick guys” can be seen zapping crabs for fun, which is a nice touch. We get to see the seahorses suffering and thirsty before the water comes back in, and then they float around happily after you’ve helped them. I like that the Metal Sharks are metal to indicate that they’re tough. Normally metal enemies are tough because Spyro can’t effectively flame them - of course, the sharks are underwater, so Spyro wouldn’t be able to flame them anyway. The metal just helps to indicate that you shouldn’t try to fight the sharks without power-ups. The level itself is colourful and interestingly shaped. Unfortunately, since the whole level is inside and/or underwater, we don’t get an amazing skybox." />

    <h3>Setting: 5 / 5</h3>
    <p class='editable' data-cms-source="/levels/Aquaria_Towers.html" data-cms-index="1">
        This is a level where Spyro very clearly helps out the world&rsquo;s natives, unlike worlds like <a href="/levels/Glimmer.html">Glimmer</a>. As you progress through the level, you fill it back up with water for your thirsty seahorse friends. This also changes the platforming dynamics of the level as you go, which is awesome. By the end of the level, the entire world is swimmable, and you can reach all sorts of new stuff.

    <h3>Quests: 3.5 / 5</h3>
    <p class='editable' data-cms-source="/levels/Aquaria_Towers.html" data-cms-index="2">
        Water levels are notorious for being unfun, but Aquaria Towers is an exception. The tower quest is a <em>little</em> tedious, although it gives some meaning to the towers you pass by throughout the level. Hunter&rsquo;s manta riding quests are pretty fun.<br />&nbsp;

    <h3>Overall: 4.3 / 5</h3>
    <p class='editable' data-cms-source="/levels/Aquaria_Towers.html" data-cms-index="3">
        On the whole, Aquaria Towers is pretty sweet (especially for a water level).
