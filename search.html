We get to see the seahorses suffering and thirsty before the water comes back in, and then they float around happily after you’ve helped them.I like that the Metal Sharks are metal to indicate that they’re tough. Normally metal enemies are tough because Spyro can’t effectively flame them - of course, the sharks are underwater, so Spyro wouldn’t be able to flame them anyway. The metal just helps to indicate that you shouldn’t try to fight the sharks without power-ups.            The level itself is colourful and interestingly shaped. Unfortunately, since the whole level is inside and/or underwater, we don’t get an amazing skybox.This is a level where Spyro very clearly helps out the world’s natives, unlike worlds like Glimmer. As you progress through the level, you fill it back up with water for your thirsty seahorse friends. This also changes the platforming dynamics of the level as you go, which is awesome. By the end of the level, the entire world is swimmable, and you can reach all sorts of new stuff.                  The enemies in this level appear to be the same villains terrorising the turtles in Sunny Beach, one of the many neat connections the game makes between levels.Water levels are notorious for being unfun, but Aquaria Towers is an exception. The tower quest is a little tedious, although it gives some meaning to the towers you pass by throughout the level. Hunter’s manta riding quests are pretty fun.On the whole, Aquaria Towers is pretty sweet (especially for a water level).      "'

The skybox is beautiful too, which earns it big points from me.As a homeworld, Autumn Plains doesn’t have much going on in terms of story or setting. Ripto shows up and takes over, and it’s your job to throw him back out - that’s about it. We don’t really learn anything about the world from Autumn Plains.There isn’t much to say about the gameplay of Autumn Plains, since it is mainly a hub for connecting other levels. We learn the Climb ability here, and there are some pretty nice gliding opportunities - otherwise the gameplay is fairly plain.Autumn Plains is an excellent homeworld. It’s a place to relax, explore and (ultimately) advance the main story. There just isn’t much to it other than that however."'

The Land Blubbers are appropriately annoying: hopping around noisily, extinguishing your fires, and laughing in your face. The fire vs. water thing is a nice touch, though it isn’t really borne out by Zephyr.Otherwise, there isn’t much exciting about this level aesthetically. The skybox is pretty, and the floating boats are kind of cool, but it’s definitely not the coolest stuff in the game.The Breeze Builders (birds) are being sabotaged by the Land Blubbers (weird slug-like people). The Blubbers keep putting out the fires powering the birds’ machines, so Spyro needs to get rid of them and re-light the fires.A cool thing about this level is that it connects with Zephyr, which takes place on the frontlines of the war between the Breeze Builders and the Land Blubbers. In Zephyr though, Spyro fights with the Land Blubbers, which is… interesting. Spyro clearly has no moral quandries with fighting both sides - as long as we get those talismans!In terms of gameplay, a lot of this level is quite frustrating. The infamous “trouble on the trolley” quest sticks out as a rough spot, but flying between floating boats and aiming finicky cannons are problematic as well.On the whole, Breeze Harbor is an alright level, but nothing to write home about."'

The rocks and lava don’t fit much with its homeworld, Winter Tundra, but most levels don’t!There is essentially no story here. It’s another speedway level. In the orb challenge, we help Hunter test out his “toy” plane by flying it around, shooting at blimps. This perhaps gives some insight into Hunter’s character, but there’s not much to say other than that.Speedway levels are always a bit of fun (at least until the 10th retry). The orb challenge in this level can be a bit frustrating though: sharp turns require super fast reactions or (more likely) lots of trial and error as you learn Hunter’s path and the positions of the blimps.Overall… it’s another speedway level. And probably not the best one."'

Spyro has to get it back. Pretty simple stuff.We meet Secret Agent Zero here, who is clearly related somehow to the secret agents in Scorch! It’s a nice touch, and helps make the whole game feel a bit more like a cohesive (if confusing) world.Cloud Temples has its own unique power-up: the Super Freeze! It’s a cool new toy to play with, although the quests involved with it can be a little frustrating since they rely on precision and quick timing.While it’s nice to meet Secret Agent Zero, his quest is one of the most annoying orb challenges in the entire game. It relies almost entirely on trial and error, and forces the player to start from scratch every time.Tucked away towards the end of the game, Cloud Temples is a little forgettable to me. It’s got some cool tricks to show off, but isn’t too impressive on the whole."'

The voice acting and animation of the monks is probably some of the funniest in the game.The monks are being terrorised by a fearsome yeti. I think that they captured it, and then it got loose? It’s not a very substantial story, especially when the yeti ends up dying unexpectedly just before the big boss fight. The whole thing is played for humour, which actually works out pretty well.The monks here are clearly supposed to be related to the natives of Idol Springs, although the connection feels a bit superficial.Two of the orbs in this level come from a tucked-away ice hockey minigame. The ice hockey is… alright. It’s pretty fun, but ice physics can always become a bit tiresome.You get the other orb by exploring the level looking for evil statues to exorcise with fire.

It’s a boss fight. That’s pretty much the story here. When you win, Ripto is expelled from Summer Forest, and he moves on to bother a different homeworld.Crush has some basic boss mechanics. He does some attacks, which you have to avoid, and then you get him while he’s vulnerable. His attacks get more varied as the fight goes on, although he only has 3 in total. It’s not a bad boss fight, but it’s also not very interesting.There’s nothing too exciting about Crush’s Dungeon. It’s a pretty standard boss level."'

The enemies are cool (haha) and often have great animations (melting when you flame them, for example). Like many enemies in the game, they interact with their environment, freezing cavemen in blocks of ice until dealt with.There’s also a cute kitty in this level, which is a massive plus.Some Ice Wizards have captured the chieftan of some artic cavemen, and Spyro needs to free him. The other cavemen seem to want him back primarily because he has all their hockey tickets, so we’ve got high stakes for this one. They seem to be referring to the hockey in Colossus, which is a nice inter-world reference to tie everything together a bit. At the end of the level, it turns out the chieftan traded away the hockey tickets anyway, which is a classic Spyro 2 kind of gag.It’s fun to watch the cavemen work together in weird ways to solve problems. The cavemen are pretty character-ful dudes on the whole, which good voice acting and jokes. This level is fun! Purging the ice wizards and thawing out cavemen is a good time, and the orb challenges are great too. One involves Super Flying around, flaming respawning spiders; it’s quite tricky, but pretty fun, and the spiders look and sound really goofy. The other involves feeding fish to a cute snow leopard called George, before reuniting him with his worried caveman owner, which is obviously lovely.A very delightful level, on all axes."'

There’s a bunch of cute vignettes to see and interact with.Dragon Shores serves entirely as a reward level for playing the rest of the game, which is awesome! Spyro has been talking about this place since the very first cutscene, so it’s exciting to actually get to walk around it and do stuff!There isn’t a lot of extra story here, but there’s some cute little scenes and we get to see a lot of characters from previous levels come back to take a bow.It’s also interesting that this place is run by Gnorcs! Apparently Spyro’s efforts in the first game had long-reaching effects for dragon-gnorc relations.We get to play a few minigames here, which is neat. One of them is a return to the troublesome trolley ride from Breeze Harbor, which is potentially frightening, but it plays a bit better without Fisher the Breezebuilder breathing down your neck.Dragon Shores could have just been a little cutscene, where Spyro finally gets to take his holiday.

The Gemcutter’s buildings are heavily-adorned with gems, which I guess impresses the importance of gems on new players, as well as looking cool. The Gemcutters themselves are cute little squirrel people. The music for this level is pretty funky too, so good overall!This level has a bit more ludo-narrative dissonance than most, which is why I’m giving it a lowish score.Every level in Spyro 2 begins with some native of the world asking Spyro to solve a problem. At the end of the level, the problem is solved and Spyro is rewarded with a gem or a talisman.In Glimmer, the Gemcutters are being invaded by gem-stealing lizards. Spyro’s task is to stop these lizards. However, it is entirely possible to get to the end of the level without battling any lizards. On the other hand, you do need to pick up 100 gems in Glimmer in order to pay a bridge toll. Spyro could be seen as just another gem-stealing lizard by the Gemcutters, so it’s a little weird when they reward you for your efforts at the end of the level.Many levels in Spyro are thematically paired. Glimmer has no ties to other levels, which is kind of a bummer (although fair enough for the very first level in the game).The spitting-rocks-at-lizards quest is fairly fun. It gives you a tour of the level, and helps new players learn to control the camera.The other two quests involve flaming crystal lamps while super-flying around, which is also pretty fun.Overall, the gameplay in Glimmer is pretty solid. It’s not too in-your-face with the tutorialising, which is mostly dished out slowly between here and Summer Forest.Glimmer definitely gets the game off on the right foot."'
